The mian goal of the analysis is to identify the trends and patternts of the electric vehicles in the Washington state.  This project analyzes the growth of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to non-electric vehicles over the years 2020 to 2024 using data from a CSV file named "Electric_Vehicle_Population_Size_History_By_County" from (https://catalog.data.gov/). In order to get the result the following tests were done.The data is visualized in a bar chart showing the annual counts of EVs and non-EVs

# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis
These data illustrating the growth of electric vehicles (EVs) versus non-electric vehicles from 2020 to 2024, The chart compares the total number of electric vehicles to non-electric vehicles over a five-year period (2020-2024). It also helps to understand the adoption rate of electric vehicles in comparison to traditional vehicles.

The proportion of electric vehicles over the specified years, highlighting trends and fluctuations in the adoption of electric vehicles.
This segment indicates that in 2017, EVs involved, on average, 6.0% of the total vehicle population. In 2018, EVs made up 6.8% of the total vehicle population.For 2019, the mean percentage of electric vehicles was 9.5%. The year 2020 saw an increase, with electric vehicles accounting for 11.1% of the total.There was a significant rise in 2021, where 17.3% of the vehicles were electric. 
In 2022, the percentage was slightly lower than 2021 at 16.8%. The year 2023 saw a further slight decline to 15.8%. In 2024, the percentage of electric vehicles increased again to 16.8%.

So, these data explore that there is a noticeable increasing trend in the percentage of electric vehicles from 2017 to 2021. However, after peaking in 2021, the percentage slightly fluctuated in the following years, with a slight decrease in 2022 and 2023, followed by an increase in 2024.

Rural VS Urban 
There has been a noticeable growth in the number of EVs in both urban and rural counties over the years. This growth is more pronounced in urban counties compared to rural counties. The number of non-EVs shows a relatively stable or declining trend, indicating a gradual shift towards electric vehicles.

The bar chart effectively demonstrates the increasing trend of electric vehicle adoption from 2020 to 2024, against a backdrop of declining non-electric vehicle numbers. The analysis reveals a clear trend of increasing EV adoption in Washington State, with urban counties leading the way. While rural counties lag, they are gradually catching up as infrastructure and awareness improve. The insights from this analysis can inform policy decisions and strategic initiatives to promote EV adoption across the state, ensuring a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation future.

BEVs and PHEVs

This bar chart displays the number of January registrations for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in Washington State from 2017 to 2024. There is a clear increasing trend in the number of registrations for both BEVs and PHEVs from 2017 to 2024. BEV registrations consistently be more than PHEV registrations each year. The gap between the number of BEV and PHEV registrations widens over time, with BEV registrations increasing at a faster rate. Both BEV and PHEV registrations show significant growth, especially noticeable in the years 2023 and 2024.

As per the data from the department of Licensing, the total number of EVs and plug-ins registered in Washington rose from 91247 in January 2023 to 134692 in January 2024.That is a surprising 43% increase in a single year. The output illustrates the growth and trends in BEV and PHEV registrations in Washington State, highlighting the increasing adoption of electric vehicles over the years.


# Conclusion
The data shows a positive trend in the adoption of electric vehicles in washington state over the years. Looking at data, it can be found that the increasing and steadily rise from 0.96% in 2020 to 2.97% in 2024. The percentage of electric vehicles increases steadily from 0.96% in 2020 to 2.97% in 2024. This indicates a positive trend in the adoption of electric vehicles in Washington State over the years. It can be also analysed that the data and visualization provide a clear picture of the growing adoption of electric vehicles from 2020 to 2024, with urban areas leading the way. To further accelerate EV adoption, especially in rural areas, targeted policies and infrastructure developments are essential. The overall growth in EV percentages is more pronounced in urban areas, which saw an increase from 1.26% in 2020 to 3.92% in 2024. In rural areas, although the growth is slower, there is still a noticeable upward trend, from 0.49% in 2020 to 1.48% in 2024.
