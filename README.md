THE RISE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES

Electric vehicles have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for sustainable transportation alternatives. With advancements in technology, expanding infrastructure, and growing environmental awareness, EVs have gained traction as viable options for consumers and policymakers alike. Washington State, known for its progressive stance on environmental sustainability, has become a focal point in this global shift towards cleaner mobility solutions.

Objectives of the Research and Analysis:

Examine Growth Trends: Analyze the trajectory of EV adoption in Washington State across our data set, primarily with a focus over the last ten years. We primary focused on the vehicle registration growth, as a way to gage consumer interest in positive trends that could pretict future trends. 

Identify Contributing Factors: Explore the variables influencing the growth of EVs, including: legislative initiatives, consumer preferences, economic factors, and demographics. 


Methodology:
Our analysis leverages comprehensive data sources, including state vehicle registrations, electric and non-electric car data sources, gasoline price and housegold median income data. By applying data-driven insights and statistical analytical tools, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of the driving forces behind the surge in EV adoption across the state.

#TAX INCENTIVES AND DIVERSITY OF SUPPLY

Starting this analysis, we wanted to get an overview of the data we had available to get a big picture of our story and find interesting aspects to further explore. We looked up total cars, unique cars, amount of cars per city, and what year had the largest amount of registrations. We didn't have the year the car was registered, bu we had the year of the car make so we were able to find a summary of the last ten years to visualize any trends.

From here, we also wanted to find a percentage growth by year and also an overall percentage growth from 2014 to 2024. This allowed us to see the steady growth of EV's, that had its peak in 2023, but continues steady in a positive direction.

Relationship between Availability of Models and the Amount of Registered Cars
Overview:
For this part of the collaborate effort to explore trends and relationships, We wanted to first focus on the relationship between the number of car models available and the total number of registered electric vehicles per year. Using a dataset of electric vehicles that we had for Washington State, We performed correlation and regression analyses to understand this relationship better.

Statistical Interpretation:
Slope: The slope of 457.10 indicates that for each additional car model introduced, there are on average 457.10 more registered vehicles.
Intercept: The intercept of -1714.18 is part of the regression equation.
R-squared: The R-squared value of 0.71 suggests that approximately 71% of the variability in the total number of vehicles can be explained by the number of car models available.
P-value: The p-value of 0.00 confirms that the regression model is statistically significant.

Conclusion:
This analysis reveals a strong positive relationship between the availability of car models and the total number of registered electric vehicles per year. Based on this we  can infer that the number of car models available could potentially drive higher vehicle registrations, highlighting the importance of diversity in model offerings to boost electric vehicle adoption. Our hypothesis was proven, as we believed that as demand for EV's increases, supply increases in variability giving the consumer more options. The statistical significance of these findings further further supports the strengtht of this relationship.

Relationship between Eligibility that Meet Government’s Standards for Tax Credits and Registered Cars

Overview:
The second relationship we wanted to explore, seems ovious and interesting at first. We wanted to see if Goverment programs created a strong enough incentive to increase demand in Electric Vehicles. We filtered the electric vehicle data to determine vehicles eligible for a potential tax credit under the "Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility" criterion. This analysis would help us understand the relationship between eligibility for tax credits and the total number of registered electric vehicles.
We wanted to start narrowing down our analysis by grouping my car data by eligible, and seeing if there is a correlation between this potential tax credit and purchase trends.

Statistical Interpretation:
We ran a linear regression analysis including Pearson's R, to find the strenght of this relationship, and then we ploted my graph accodingly. 
The R-squared value of 0.17 indicates that approximately 17% of the variability in the total number of vehicles can be explained by the number of eligible vehicles. This suggests a weak but positive relationship. There might be other significant factors influencing the total number of vehicles that are not captured by this model.

![Fig4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/738ccad1-b62c-4aa9-a215-bd949d7949c9)

This indicates that for each additional eligible vehicle, there is an estimated average increase of approximately 1.56 in the total number of vehicles. This suggests that vehicles eligible for government incentives or benefits are positively contributing to the total number of registered vehicles

Conclusion:
The analysis proves that their a weak positive relationship between the availability of government tax credits for clean alternative fuel vehicles and the total number of registered electric vehicles. Even thought there is an increase in eligible vehicles as the total number of registered vehicles grows, the effect is not very strong. This finding was surpising, as we expected that a potential tax incentive would intice a higher response in demand. This suggests that other factors, for example infrastructure, consumer education or gas price, could be playing a bigger role when it comes to determining electric vehicle growth in the State of Washington.
